Yep Another Planning Poker (WIP)
=======

### Roadmap
 - [x] making app still work after installing React & bundler
 - [x] Migrate current app to fully support React-only (no legacy jQuery code)
 - [x] Migrate app to use Redux
 - [x] Migrate app to use Ramda
 - [ ] Cover app with unit tests
##### Slowly migrate to using Planning Poker functionality
 - [ ] One room for everyone; all are moderators. Once all joined, one clicks 'start' and people can type their value. Last value wins. After one clicks 'reveal', messages are shown.
 - [ ] Add moderator role. He invites people to the chat. Moderator selects stories to be reviewed and set estimation result.
 - [ ] Room management & permanent links.
 - [ ] Add values (cards) & ability to customize them for moderator.
 - [ ] Auth & personalise rooms (store related data per room).
 - [ ] Add customizable timer, re-vote buttons, role management, etc.
 - [ ] Add ability to store ideal relative estimation examples per room (team).
 - [ ] Other enhancements

##### Possible perks:
 - if person has not voted yet - 'blood beat screen effect' to make one pay attention.
